										<p>About Me</p>
									</header>
                                    
									<p>Hi, I’m Siya Taparia and I'm a student at William Fremd High School. I've always loved science but I started becoming interested in neurobiology specifically once I took Anatomy and Psychology classes my junior year of high school. Neurobiology is defined as a branch of the life sciences that deals with the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the nervous system. I like how broad the field is because it isn't limited to a single aspect of neurology which means that I can explore not only how the brain and nervous system work, but also how they relate to things like psychology and pathology/diseases.</p>
                                    
                                    <p> I love learning about the brain and how it develops, as well as behavioral neurobiology and psychology. I created this blog to share interesting topics I research about. Enjoy!</p>

											<h2>Covid-19 vs. the Nervous System</h2>
											<p>June 29, 2020</p>
										</header>
										<p>We are currently living through a major historical event: the coronavirus. The virus has already had a big impact on my life and will continue to in the future, but I realized that I don’t actually know much about the virus itself except for the fact that it affects the respiratory system. Given that pandemics like this are rare and we are currently experiencing one, I decided to learn about the virus and its more advanced effects.</p>

                                        <h4>How Does the Virus Affect the Nervous System?</h4>
                                        <p>Although scientists know that neurological manifestation is an effect of Covid-19, it is unclear how exactly the virus affects the brain. There are many possibilities which are separated into direct and secondary effects. The first theory is that the virus directly enters the nervous system through the olfactory bulb which is located in the olfactory sulcus of the medial orbitofrontal cortex and is responsible for sending input about odors to the brain. This theory could explain why many Covid-19 patients experience symptoms like loss of smell, however, the theory is not proven. Another theory about direct manifestation is that Covid-19 could create an infection rooted in the brain stem which would therefore create respiratory issues. A theory about secondary infection is that the brain is affected not because of the virus, but because of the body’s response to the virus which could damage the nervous system. This has been seen with other viruses such as the flu. As described by Igor Koralnik, professor of neurology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, when the body fights the flu, the response can cause dizziness and headaches. Another way Covid-19 can have a secondary effect on the nervous system is through a loss of oxygen. Because the virus damages the lungs, a depletion of oxygen occurs in the body which could in turn injure the brain and nervous system.</p>

                                        <h4>Covid-19 and Blood Clots</h4>
                                        <p>A few different aspects of the virus cause blood clots. First, Covid-19 causes inflammation which provokes the body’s clotting system. The body has a natural tendency to clot when it encounters infection, however this natural tendency can be especially threatening when it is a reaction to Covid-19. Another thing that causes clotting is immobility. When people are infected with Covid-19, they likely spend the majority of their time resting and are not active. When this happens, their leg muscles are not being put to use and the venous blood flow is severely decreased, which causes clotting. When these two factors, inflammation and immobility, are put together, they create the ideal atmosphere for blood clots to thrive in. According to Alex Spyropoulos, a professor of medicine at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine who has been studying patients with blood clotting disorders for many years, Covid-19 is one of the most clot-causing diseases he has encountered. Spyropoulos says that the risk of blood clots are 3-6 times higher in Covid-19 patients. This can cause damage to the nervous system because blood clots can induce numerous life threatening diseases such as stroke. Although it is not certain what causes strokes in Covid-19 patients, scientists speculate that blood clots are a huge contributor. Treatment is changing in response to this, as patients whose clotting systems aren’t hugely active are receiving small doses of blood thinners or are using compression socks. Patients who have highly active clotting systems are receiving larger doses of blood thinners to prevent clotting.</p>

                                        <p>The misconception that Covid-19 only affects the respiratory system is being disproved as the number of cases of nervous system damage are increasing. It is important to take all necessary precautions to mitigate damage as much as possible. It, quite literally, takes nerves to fight Covid-19.</p>

											<h2>Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
											<p>August 30, 2020</p>
										</header>
                                    
                                        <h4>What is Alzheimer's Disease</h4>
										<p>Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive brain disorder that destroys memory skills, eventually leading to the inability to perform simple tasks. Most people with AD begin to experience symptoms in their mid-60s; this is called late-onset. In some cases, people begin experiencing symptoms between their 30’s and 60’s; this is called early-onset and is very rare. The early stages of AD are most commonly characterized by memory loss, but people also experience difficulty recalling words, vision/spatial issues, and impaired judgment. As the disease progresses, these issues get more severe and can lead to angry and violent tendencies. The biggest known risk factor for Alzheimer’s is increasing age, as in the United States, 1 in 10 people over the age of 65 have AD.</p>
                                    
                                        <h4>The Neurobiology of Alzheimer’s Disease</h4>
                                        <p>The disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzhemier who in 1906 examined the brain of a woman who had died of a mysterious mental illness with symptoms of memory loss, language problems, and unpredictable behavior. Once her brain was examined, many abnormalities were found: clumps (now called amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fiber (now called neurofibrillary/tau tangles). Amyloid plaques are formed when the brain protein amyloid precursor protein (APP) is broken down into small fragments. The small fragments then clump together and form plaque. These amyloid plaques then cause the toxic neurofibrillary tangles, and this causes neuron death. Neurons are the fundamental unit of the brain and nervous system as they are responsible for turning stimulus into action. They receive sensory input and send motor signals to our muscles. The damage begins in the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory, and as more and more neurons die, the disease spreads.</p>
                                    
                                        <h4>APP and Amyloid Plaques</h4>
                                        <p>To further investigate the relationship between APP/Amyloid Plaques and neuron death, Professor Ernst Wolvetang of the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology used stem cells from people with Down syndrome since they usually develop early onset Alzheimer’s Disease. Using the stem cells, researchers grew neurons and used CRISPR to change the levels of APP. They found that as the levels of APP increased, more clumps formed. This is why reducing amyloid plaques is the main focus in developing treatments to the disease.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>The misconception that Covid-19 only affects the respiratory system is being disproved as the number of cases of nervous system damage are increasing. It is important to take all necessary precautions to mitigate damage as much as possible. It, quite literally, takes nerves to fight Covid-19.</p>

											<h2>The Aging Brain</h2>
											<p>DATE GOES HERE</p>
										</header>
                                    
                                        <p>Memory loss with age is a natural part of life. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, approximately 40% of people over the age of 65 experience age associated memory loss, and about 1% progress to dementia every year. It is also said that the older you are, the wiser you are; this remains true despite age associated memory impairment.</p>
                                        <p>It used to be believed that humans’ brain ability increases until the mid 20’s, reaches its peak, then gradually declines. However, scientists now know that the human brain is constantly changing and never remains steady. While some components of brain function decrease with age, many other components increase.</p>
                                    
                                        <h4>What is responsible for age associated memory loss?</h4>
										<p>The hippocampus is a small portion of the brain that is responsible for things associated with learning, emotions, and memories. The hippocampus grows easily, but it also shrinks just as easily with age. What causes its shrinking is the degradation of myelin, the layer that surrounds the nerves in the brain. This layer gradually wears down which not only decreases protection to nerve fibers, but also slows the speed of communication between neurons. Neurons are able to communicate because of their receptors, but when these wear down, communication becomes far more difficult. Because of this, it becomes harder for the brain to process and retain new memories and to recover information already stored.</p>
                                    
                                        <h4>Does the brain only weaken with age?</h4>
                                        <p>No, many aspects of the brain improve with age. For one, older brains naturally have a more positive outlook which leads to improved brain function. According to Harvard Business Review, older brains focus on what is possible instead of the negative aspects of life. Younger brains naturally focus on the negative and potential problems. Because of this, older brains have an easier time thinking of solutions to problems. Another way the brain improves with age is that older brains see the bigger picture in life. This is thanks to dendrites which are structures on neurons that receive electrical messages. According to Harvard Health Publishing, “branching of dendrites increases, and connections between distant brain areas strengthen”. This allows older  brains to be better at analyzing and detecting relationships between various pieces of information and seeing the bigger picture. These two benefits of the aging brain are what lead to increased wisdom and are at the root of the famous saying: “The older you get, the wiser you are”</p>
